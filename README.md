**FINAL PROJECT REPORT:**

**ABSTRACT :**

Voting Management System(VMS) is a responsive website to

manage elections in NITC campus. This is our first version of the website and

Minimum Viable Product(MVP) of our idea.

**INTRODUCTION & BACKGROUND :**

All the project team members belong to the Electrical & Electronics

Engineering Branch. We got an opportunity from RS Group to be part of their

Training and Internship. They reviewed our resumes and passed it to Murali

Vasudevan sir(Mentor) since the resume highlighted some software skills.

This made us into a team and decided to do a project under full

stack development. Before deciding our team has the first challenge to decide to

do an internship under EEE related or software related. We decided to do it

under software after good analysis.

Deciding software is one of the challenges but another big challenge

was to empathize with the problems in our institute and have a clear idea what to

build. Before finalizing with VMS we went with many ideas and analyzing the

challenges to be faced to implement them.

Finally we decided to build a website VMS for our Institute Elections.

Then we took a long time to build the design and architecture of our project. We

had done many versions of design.

**PROJECT OUTLINE :**

Many elections are conducted at NIT Calicut to decide the

representatives at various levels in the electoral process.

It uses multiple Google Forms for different elections, which is inconvenient for

voters.

A dedicated voting platform would consolidate all election processes and improve

voter response and representation.

The platform would integrate manifestos into the website so that voters can make

an informed choice, and it would be difficult to create fake voting sheets or

manipulate voters.

Overall, a dedicated voting platform would improve the electoral process at NITC.



<a name="br2"></a> 

Here are some specific problems with the current system and how the proposed

platform would address them:

● Voters must find the Google Form for each election, which is inconvenient

and can lead to low voter turnout. The proposed platform would have a

single website for all elections, making it easier to vote by voter.

● Voters need to know who to vote for because they need access to the

candidates' manifestos. The proposed platform would integrate the

manifestos into the website so that voters can make an informed choice.

● Google Forms can be easily faked, which could lead to voter fraud. The

proposed platform would be more secure, making creating fake voting

sheets or threatening voters harder.

● Overall, the proposed platform would improve the electoral process at

NITC by making it more convenient, informative, and secure.

● Publish Results fast.

● Only One vote per Candidate.

● Every user must be able to vote only once.

● Results should be displayed clearly to the admin after the deadline of voting.

● It must also have functionality to perform key tasks, unavailable for voters or

candidates. Voters, candidate,admin.

● The choices should be made clear.

● Attach a manifesto of each candidate to show while the vote is being casted.

**Design:**

We made a design document of the website before starting our building

stage.

**Build:**

● We started building our website on 19-06-2023.

● Before starting building the website we took 3 weeks to learn the needed

technical skills.

● Initially based on our design document we started making the frontend of

each page.

● First we made a landing page of users using HTML,CSS where we tried

many styles on this and finalized.

● We used the same CSS styling for all pages.

● We used php and Mysql for developing the backend and database

handling.

● Used session handling for maintaining user login website.

● For finalizing the login page we made many analyses like google

authentication experiment,etc and built it.

● We faced many challenges and bugs during the building stage. It includes

solving Session destroying and creating separate sessions for admin and

user, interfering one session in other,etc.



<a name="br4"></a> 

● Parallelly we had done unit tests and debugging.

● Testing was done by both teams including mentors.

**Deploy :**

● We took domain i.e campaigners.in and web hosting account from

Hostinger. Before this account we used XAMPP and VS-code for building.

**Soft Skills :**

● Problem-Solving ability

● Documentation

● Communication

● Team Work

● Time management

● Planning

**Project Plan:**

● Just after deciding to do an internship in the software domain we made a

project plan.

● In our project plan we divided all work to be done step by step and gave

deadlines to each task.

● This all plan was done under the mentorship of Murali sir.

● We used to update the project plan regularly based on the status of tasks.

● Reference for project plan:

**Time Tracking:**

● Every team member has created their own time sheets.

● The tasks done by each of them and time spent on it is tracked in their

respective sheets.

● This gave us a clear understanding that at least each of them should spent

nearly 5-6 hrs a day.

● Generally when we start doing any task sometimes we spend the whole

day finishing it and we don't care about the time. This was a good

experience of work.

● We used to have a clear idea on what we did by referring to the time

sheets.

**Meeting Protocol:**

● There would be regular meetings with our mentor and whole team.

● We also note down the Minutes of the meetings.



<a name="br5"></a> 

● Generally the meetings were held between 9-12 PM IST.

● Meetings are held on the G-meet platform.

● We also had many meetings among only team members for many tasks.

**Analysis of Design with MVP:**

**Design**

**Original MVP**

Expected to do Google sign in.

Designed for all results on one page.

Built a login page which is secure.

Built results page in an effective way

as per response from user.

In the admin results page we included But in MVP we made both Voting

only Voting responses.

Responses and Candidates Results.

**Updates After building:**

● We had done refactoring of code by making separate files for backend and

frontend.

● And used global variables, functions and database connection in separate

files.

**Features to be added:**

● To update the website for using it for SAC Elections.

● Update Database.

● Add features in admin results pages.

● Refactor the code using OOPs.

● Can make it more responsive.

●

**Future of website:**

● Our team is at present focusing on campus placements.

● We may hand over our files to our juniors to develop the website.

● We can be mentors for our juniors.
